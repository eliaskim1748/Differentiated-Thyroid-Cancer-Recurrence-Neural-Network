# Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Neural Network
## About

In oncology, predicting cancer recurrence is a major challenge. Differentiated thyroid cancer usually has a good prognosis, but its potential to return complicates treatment. To tackle this, I created a feed-forward neural network designed to improve the accuracy and speed of recurrence predictions for this type of cancer. By analyzing complex patterns in clinical data, this model aims to refine our predictions and move us toward more personalized treatment plans. The goal is to better understand each patientâ€™s risk and tailor treatments for improved outcomes.
