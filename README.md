## About

## Description of Variables

Age
Description: The patient's age in years.
Gender 
Description: The patient’s sex.
Smoking
Description: Indicates whether the patient smokes.
Hx Smoking
Description: Indicates whether the patient has a history of smoking, even if they are not a current smoker.
Hx Radiotherapy
Description: Indicates whether the patient has previously received radiation therapy.
Thyroid Function
Description: Refers to the status of thyroid function (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that regulates thyroid function by stimulating the thyroid to produce the hormones T3 and T4).
Euthyroid: 
The thyroid is functioning normally with balanced levels of thyroid hormones (T3, T4) and TSH.
Clinical Hyperthyroidism: 
The thyroid is overactive, producing excess thyroid hormones (high T3, T4) with low TSH, causing symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
Clinical Hypothyroidism: 
The thyroid is underactive, producing insufficient thyroid hormones (low T3, T4) with high TSH, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism.
Subclinical Hyperthyroidism: 
Thyroid hormone levels (T3, T4) are normal, but TSH is low, indicating early or mild hyperthyroidism without significant symptoms.
Subclinical Hypothyroidism: 
Thyroid hormone levels (T3, T4) are normal, but TSH is high, indicating early or mild hypothyroidism without significant symptoms.
Physical Examination
Description: Results from a physical examination. 
Single Nodular Goiter (Left or Right):
This is when a single nodule (lump) forms on one side of the thyroid gland, either left or right.
Multinodular Goiter:
This is when multiple nodules develop in the thyroid, causing an enlargement of the gland.
Normal:
This indicates a thyroid with no nodules or abnormalities.
Diffuse Goiter:
This refers to an overall enlargement of the thyroid gland without distinct nodules.
Adenopathy
Description: Refers to the presence of lymphadenopathy, which means swollen or enlarged lymph nodes. 
Pathology
Description: Describes the pathological findings of the thyroid tissue. 
Micropapillary: 
A tiny, less aggressive type of thyroid cancer with small finger-like projections under the microscope.
Papillary: 
The most common thyroid cancer, known for its slow growth and characteristic finger-like projections.
Follicular: 
A type of thyroid cancer that forms in the thyroid’s follicles and can spread to other parts of the body.
Hurthle Cell: 
A rarer, more aggressive thyroid cancer with large, abnormal cells that can be harder to treat.
Focality
Description: Refers to the number and distribution of cancerous foci within the thyroid gland. 
Focal: 
The cancer is only in one spot or nodule within the thyroid.
Multifocal: 
The cancer is found in more than one spot or nodule within the thyroid. 
Risk
Description: Refers to the likelihood of the cancer spreading or worsening.
T
Description: Refers to the size and extent of the tumor
T1a: 
The tumor is 1 cm or smaller and confined to the thyroid. It is usually a small, early-stage cancer.
T1b: 
The tumor is larger than 1 cm but 2 cm or smaller and confined to the thyroid. It remains localized but is slightly larger than T1a.
T2: 
The tumor is larger than 2 cm but 4 cm or smaller and confined to the thyroid. It is still within the thyroid but is more significant in size.
T3a: 
The tumor is larger than 4 cm and is still confined to the thyroid, meaning it hasn't spread outside the gland.
T3b: 
The tumor has extended beyond the thyroid capsule into surrounding tissues, but it does not invade major structures like the trachea or esophagus.
T4a: 
The tumor has invaded nearby structures such as the surrounding soft tissues or the larynx, trachea, or esophagus, but it is still not widespread.
T4b: 
The tumor has invaded more distant structures, including major organs or tissues like the neck muscles, or has extensive local invasion.
N
Description: Refers to the involvement of regional lymph nodes. It shows whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and, if so, how many and to what extent.
N0: 
No regional lymph node involvement; the cancer has not spread to the nearby lymph nodes.
N1a: 
Cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor, but the lymph nodes are 3 cm or smaller.
N1b: 
Cancer has spread to lymph nodes either on the opposite side of the neck from the primary tumor, in multiple lymph nodes, or in lymph nodes larger than 3 cm, indicating more extensive regional spread.
M
Description: Describes whether the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body beyond the primary tumor site.
M0: 
Indicates that the cancer has not spread to distant organs or tissues.
M1:
Indicates that the cancer has spread to distant organs or tissues, such as the lungs, liver, or bones.
Stage
Description: Refers to the extent and severity of cancer, describing how far it has spread from its original site
Stage I: 
The cancer is small and localized to the primary site with no spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant parts of the body.
Stage II: 
The cancer is larger or has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes but has not spread to distant parts of the body.
Stage III: 
The cancer has spread more extensively to nearby lymph nodes and/or tissues but has not metastasized to distant organs.
Stage IVA: 
The cancer has spread to nearby structures such as the larynx or trachea and/or extensive regional lymph node involvement but has not yet metastasized to distant organs.
Stage IVB: 
The cancer has spread to distant organs or tissues beyond the regional area, indicating a more advanced stage of the disease.
Response
Description: Refers to how effectively the cancer is reacting to the prescribed therapy
Indeterminate: 
The treatment response is unclear, with results not providing a definitive answer about the status of the cancer.
Excellent: 
The treatment has achieved a very favorable outcome, often with no detectable cancer remaining.
Structural Incomplete: 
The treatment has not fully resolved or removed all visible cancerous structures or tumors.
Biochemical Incomplete: 
The treatment has not fully normalized abnormal biochemical markers or hormone levels associated with cancer.
Recurrence
Description: Indicates whether the cancer has returned or not
